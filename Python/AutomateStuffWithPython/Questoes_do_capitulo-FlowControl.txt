5. ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
6. The = (assignment) is used for delegating values to variables and the == (equal to) is used for comparing values that will result in a boolean value
7.A condition is a comparing parameter that will equal to a boolean value in order to validate a statement, you would use one in a while loop i.e..
8. 1. if spam == 10:; 2. if spam > 5:; 3.else:.
9.
spam = int(input('Type in a value: '))
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings')
10.crtl + C
11.break: it will exit the loop identation and continue in the next block;
   continue: it will go to the next loop;
12. 1. it counts from 0 to 11; 2. it counts from 0 to 9; 3. it count from 0 to 9 in step values defined as 1.
13.
    For:
for i in range (1, 11):
    print(i)

    While:
spam = 1
while spam <= 10:
    print(spam)
    spam += 1
14. spam.bacon()
Extra: the abs() return the absolute value of a number, lets say given value is -12, it returns 12; the round() rounds the number to the next or rpevious integer.
